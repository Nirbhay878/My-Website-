  <section>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nirbhay. I’m a first-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Sydney, driven by curiosity and a deep love for building and understanding things. My journey in tech started with coding and freelance projects during high school, and over the years, I've expanded my focus to include digital logic, circuit design, and 3D modeling. I’ve been able to fund my own projects through freelance work and have been grateful to work with some talented teams along the way.</p>

    <h2>Beliefs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning is lifelong. I believe in staying curious, open, and ready to tackle new challenges.</li>
      <li>Progress matters. Early on, I’ve seen the impact of setting small, consistent goals that build over time.</li>
      <li>Hands-on learning is essential. Building something yourself teaches more than any lecture.</li>
      <li>People and experiences shape you. I value directness, kindness, and the chance to grow through meaningful connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
    <p>I’m passionate about understanding complex systems, and I’m always in pursuit of the next challenge. Engineering and technology give me the chance to work on practical solutions, apply creativity, and contribute something meaningful. Someday, I hope to work on impactful projects in aerospace and robotics, fields that inspire and push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
    <p>For now, I’m building a strong foundation in engineering and looking forward to connecting with others who share the same drive. If that sounds like you, let’s connect!</p>
